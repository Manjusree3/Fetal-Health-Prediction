Fetal health monitoring is a critical aspect of prenatal care that helps in the early detection of potential complications that may affect the well-being of both the mother and the unborn child. Cardiotocography (CTG) is a widely used non-invasive diagnostic tool that records fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions, providing valuable insights into fetal health conditions. However, interpreting CTG data manually can be a complex and time-consuming task, requiring medical expertise to analyze patterns and detect abnormalities. Moreover, human errors in judgment can lead to misdiagnoses, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes. With the advancement of machine learning, automated classification models can help analyze CTG data more efficiently, reducing reliance on manual interpretation while improving accuracy. The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning-based system that classifies fetal health into three categories—Normal, Suspect, and Pathological—based on CTG parameters. By leveraging data-driven techniques, healthcare professionals can receive real-time insights into fetal conditions, enabling timely interventions and better decision-making in prenatal care. 



The project focuses on preprocessing and analyzing a publicly available fetal health dataset, extracting meaningful patterns, and applying multiple 
machine learning algorithms to classify fetal health status. The dataset is first examined for missing values, duplicate records, and outliers to ensure
high-quality data for model training. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize correlations among features, distribution patterns, and key influencing factors in fetal health classification. Feature selection techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used to identify the most significant predictors, enhancing model efficiency and interpretability. Various classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble learning approaches like AdaBoost and XGBoost, are trained and evaluated using cross-validation techniques. The performance of these models is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Through this study, the goal is to determine the most effective classification model that can provide reliable and accurate fetal health predictions, ultimately contributing to improved prenatal diagnostics and maternal healthcare outcomes.
